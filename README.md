# Web 3 Blockchain Website

This project is a decentralized Web 3.0 application (DApp) built using **React.js** for the frontend and **Solidity** for the backend smart contracts. The application leverages blockchain technology to offer a secure, transparent, and decentralized platform, providing users with functionalities such as cryptocurrency transactions and blockchain-based interactions.

## Features ✨

- **Decentralized Architecture**: Built on blockchain for transparency and security.
- **Smart Contract Integration**: Powered by Solidity to enable seamless and secure transactions.
- **Cryptocurrency Transactions**: Users can send and receive cryptocurrencies directly through the application.
- **Blockchain Interaction**: Demonstrates Web 3.0 capabilities with user-friendly functionality.
- **Modern UI**: A responsive and interactive user interface built with React.js.

## Technologies Used 🛠️

### Frontend
- **React.js**: For building a responsive and dynamic user interface.
- **CSS**: To style components for an intuitive user experience.
- **Web3.js**: To interact with the blockchain network.

### Backend
- **Solidity**: For creating and deploying smart contracts.
- **Ethereum**: The blockchain network used for this project.
- **MetaMask**: For user authentication and wallet integration.

## Prerequisites 📋

Ensure you have the following installed:
1. **Node.js**: For running the React development server.
2. **MetaMask**: A browser extension for wallet integration and Ethereum interaction.
3. **Ganache or Infura**: For running a local blockchain instance or connecting to a test network.

## How to Run Locally 🚀

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/web3-blockchain-website.git
   cd web3-blockchain-website
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies**:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Compile and Deploy Smart Contracts**:
   - Navigate to the `contracts` folder and compile the Solidity smart contracts using `truffle` or `hardhat`.
   - Deploy the smart contracts to a local blockchain or testnet and note the contract address.

4. **Connect the Frontend**:
   - Update the contract address and ABI in the frontend configuration.

5. **Run the Application**:
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```
   Open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:3000`.

## Smart Contract Overview 📝

The smart contracts are written in Solidity and handle the core blockchain logic, including:
- **Transaction Handling**: Sending and receiving funds securely.
- **Data Storage**: Keeping transaction details immutable and decentralized.
- **Ownership Validation**: Ensuring the validity of user addresses.
